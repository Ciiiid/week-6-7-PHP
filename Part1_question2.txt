Question 2: What is the output of var_dump($person);?

print_r('Hello');
print_r([1,2,3]);

class Person {
	public $name;
	public $age;
}


$person = new Person();
$person->name = "Alice";
$person->age = 25;


Answer: by using var_dump, it will simply display the information about a variable, including its data type,  size and value.

var_dump($person);

output:
	string(5) "Alice"
	int(25)
